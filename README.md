# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle Graphics library. In this game, the player controls a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game increasingly challenging.

## Features

- **Basic Gameplay**: Control a snake to eat food and grow longer.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the snake hits a wall or its own tail.
- **Score Tracking**: The player's score increases each time the snake eats food.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays a game over message when the player loses.

- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics Library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

No additional installation is required if you have Python installed.
